## Stretch Problems

- Persist Cart Items using `localStorage`. (If you try this one, it will be a bit tricky to get our items to populate the shopping cart on a refresh. You'll have to think about where the data actually lives, and how you can get data there from localStorage when the app is being mounted after a refresh. Good luck!)
